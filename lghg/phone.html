NA in Place by Phone (audio only) – March 31, 2020

Using your phone dial 1-669-900-6833 then enter meeting ID 526022691#

Hit # again when prompted for a user code.
Use *6 to mute and unmute yourself.
Use *9 to raise your hand.

My phone (an Android) also has an icon to toggle for mute/unmute but I don’t think it actually worked. People didn’t seem to hear me when I used that. In fact, I'm not sure anyone heard me when I used *6, either, but that might just be that there were a lot of people in the meeting and lots of background noise.
