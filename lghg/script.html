<h2 style="color:#008000";>What is the Narcotics Anonymous Program?</h2>


<p  style="color:#000000">NA is a nonprofit fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem. We are recovering addicts who meet regularly to help each other stay clean. This is a program of complete abstinence from all drugs. There is only one requirement for membership, the desire to stop using. We suggest that you keep an open mind and give yourself a break. Our program is a set of principles written so simply that we can follow them in our daily lives. The most important thing about them is that they work.</p>
<p  style="color:#000000">There are no strings attached to N.A. We are not affiliated with any other organizations, we have no initiation fees or dues, no pledges to sign, no promises to make to anyone. We are not connected with any political, religious, or law enforcement groups, and are under no surveillance at any time. Anyone may join us, regardless of age, race, sexual identity, creed, religion or lack of religion.</p>
<p  style="color:#000000">We are not interested in what or how much you used, who your connections were, what you have done in the past, how much or how little you have, but only in what you want to do about your problem and how we can help. The newcomer is the most important person at any meeting, because we can only keep what we have by giving it away. We have learned from our group experience that those who keep coming to our meetings regularly stay clean.</p>

<p>Is there anyone in their first 30 days who would like to introduce themselves by their first name and where you're calling from? This is not to embarrass you, just so we may get to know you better. Please raise your hand in Zoom and I will call on you.<b><i>(Write down names)</i></b></p>

<p>Thank you everyone for reading</>


<p>
An excerpt from our fourth tradition states, "It is also important to consider how we're viewed by society. When N.A. meetings first began in many places, it was illegal for addicts to meet under any circumstances. Even where meetings are legal, the public often views groups of addicts with alarm. Until N.A. has established a good public reputation, it may be difficult for addicts to find meeting places. If our behavior as N.A. members is still destructive and selfish, we will once again have difficulty meeting openly. We help protect our reputation as a fellowship when we use our meeting facilities with respect, keeping them clean and in good repair. We should take care to act like good neighbors, conducting ourselves respectfully. If the public reputation of Narcotics Anonymous is somehow impaired, addicts may die."<p>
