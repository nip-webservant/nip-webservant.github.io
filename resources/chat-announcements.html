<h2>IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT SMOKING/VAPING</h2>
<div id="wrap">
RE: SMOKING/VAPING<br />
Thanks for your question.  Several folks have mentioned that vaping and smoking can be triggering. Also it's not permitted at our home group meetings.  Given it's very simple to disable the camera, or to smoke off-camera, we made the call to request folks don't vape on camera. Thanks for your understanding.

<h2>Spiritual Principles Meeting</h2>
<div id="wrap">
This is a Spiritual Principles meeting. The secretary has a List of
100 Spiritual Principles. We will use the raise hand feature for
sharing. When your name is called, please unmute and select a number
1-100, a spiritual principle will be read and then you can share
</div>


<h2>WHERE DID THE LIST OF 100 SPIRITUAL PRINCIPLES COME FROM?</h2>
<div id="wrap">
This is a variation on our in-person "popsicle stick" meetings - we have a bucket of popsicle sticks with principles on each one, and attendees pick a stick at random and share on the principle. When the meetings went online, we copied all the principles from the sticks and used those as a basis. Then we extracted a bunch more principles from the Basic Text (seems like thereâ€™s one or two on each page!)
